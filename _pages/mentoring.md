In general, please reach out if you have questions about my research, UW or UWNLP, getting a masters or PhD in NLP, or doing research in industry. Happy to help in any way that I can!

If you are applying to grad school, I'd recommend checking out my blog post on [writing a good personal statement](https://suchin.io/personal-statement-advice/).

## Undergrads and Masters Students

Getting research experience is the best way to figure out whether you'd like to pursue a PhD. Research experience is also required for most PhD programs these days.

I've collaborated with many [awesome](##collaborators) undergrads and masters students before. If you are an undergrad or master's student at UW, new to NLP research and excited to try it out, do reach out!

If you are looking to collaborate, please email me a brief overview of your general research interests, as well as your resume. I mostly care about what NLP problems you are interested in, your previous experience, as well as your short-term career goals. I prefer working with folks who are interested in doing NLP in industry or academia. Most of the projects I work on have a heavy programming component, so it's necessary that you have worked on previous projects with Python (especially [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/) and associated libraries, e.g. [Fairseq](https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq) and [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/)) before.

If you don't have such experience yet, there are [lots](https://huggingface.co/) of [great](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/) [online](https://github.com/jacobeisenstein/gt-nlp-class) [resources](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/) to get up and running, as well as [NLP classes](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse517/) at UW that you could take.

If I am too busy for new collaborations, I will try to connect you with other folks who may be available and align with your interests.
