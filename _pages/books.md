Set in the 20th century, *Pachinko* follows a multi-generational Korean family as they navigate the harsh conditions of racism and poverty in Japanese-occupied Korea and Japan.

The first thing that jumped out to me after finishing this book is that it is *really* well written. Although it covers almost a century of political and intergenerational issues, it doesn't feel like it's squeezing in too much content. Each chapter usually fast-forwards a couple years in the family's story, but you never feel like you've missed a beat. The author beautifully weaves in personal dynamics between family members with larger sociopolitical conflicts of the Asian region during this period (e.g. The Depression, World War II, Korean War, etc.).

Each character had complex motivations throughout the story, but each could be clearly traced back to the effects of racism, inter-generational, the patriarchy, and more. It was so interesting to be able to connect each character's development to these larger social issues at play, which are culturally universal and relatable in some form or another.

Really great book if you're looking for a beautifully written, sweeping historical fiction. I learned a ton about the 20th century Korean experience, and found a lot of parallels to the Indian and Indian-American immigrant experience.
