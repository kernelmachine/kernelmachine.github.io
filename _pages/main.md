I'm a 2nd year PhD student in Computer Science at the [University of Washington](https://www.cs.washington.edu/), and a visiting researcher at [Facebook AI Research](https://ai.facebook.com/), in the Seattle NLP group. I'm advised by [Noah Smith](https://nasmith.github.io/) and [Luke Zettlemoyer](https://www.cs.washington.edu/people/faculty/lsz). I was previously a Predoctoral Young Investigator at [AI2](http://allenai.org), and a data scientist and software engineer in startups in Boston and Seattle. And in another world, I did research in [neuroscience](#neuroscience)!


I do research in natural language processing and machine learning. My main research interests are:

 * Adaptive and rapidly customizable [language models](#language-models)
 * [Ethical and safety concerns](#safety-and-ethics) in language models
 * [Green AI](#efficiency)
 * [Evaluation](#evaluation)
