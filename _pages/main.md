I'm a 2nd year PhD student in Computer Science at the [University of Washington](https://www.cs.washington.edu/), and a visiting researcher at [Facebook AI Research](https://ai.facebook.com/). I'm advised by [Noah Smith](https://nasmith.github.io/) and [Luke Zettlemoyer](https://www.cs.washington.edu/people/faculty/lsz).

I was previously a Predoctoral Young Investigator at [AI2](http://allenai.org), and a data scientist and software engineer in startups in Boston and Seattle. And in another world, I did research in [neuroscience](#neuroscience)!


I do research in natural language processing and machine learning. My main research interests are:

 * <span style="color:#daa520"><i class="fas fa-shield-alt"></i></span>  [**Safety and ethics**](https://suchin.io/publications/#safety-and-ethics) of language models
