I'm a 2nd year PhD student in Computer Science at the [University of Washington](https://www.cs.washington.edu/), and a visiting researcher at [Facebook AI Research](https://ai.facebook.com/). I'm advised by [Noah Smith](https://nasmith.github.io/) and [Luke Zettlemoyer](https://www.cs.washington.edu/people/faculty/lsz).

I was previously a Predoctoral Young Investigator at [AI2](http://allenai.org), and a data scientist and software engineer in startups in Boston and Seattle. And in another world, I did research in [neuroscience](#neuroscience)!


I do research in natural language processing and machine learning. My main research interests are:

 * <i class="fas fa-wind"></i> Adaptive and rapidly customizable [**language models**](#language-models)
 * <i class="fas fa-shield-alt"></i>  [**Ethics and safety**](#safety-and-ethics) of language models
 * <i class="fas fa-leaf"></i> [**Green AI**](#efficiency)
 * <i class="fas fa-sort-amount-down"></i> Improving [**Model Evaluation**](#evaluation)
