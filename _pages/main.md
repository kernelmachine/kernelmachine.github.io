I'm a 3rd year PhD candidate in Computer Science at the [University of Washington](https://www.cs.washington.edu/), and a visiting researcher at [Facebook AI Research](https://ai.facebook.com/). I'm advised by [Noah Smith](https://nasmith.github.io/) and [Luke Zettlemoyer](https://www.cs.washington.edu/people/faculty/lsz).

I was previously a Predoctoral Young Investigator at [AI2](http://allenai.org), and a data scientist and software engineer in startups in Boston and Seattle. And in another world, I did research in [neuroscience](#neuroscience)!

I do research in natural language processing and machine learning. My main research interests are:

 * <span style="color:#add8e6"><i class="fas fa-wind"></i></span> Adaptive and rapidly customizable language models
 * <span style="color:#daa520"><i class="fas fa-shield-alt"></i></span>  Safety and ethics of language models
 * <span style="color:#32cd77"><i class="fas fa-leaf"></i></span> Green AI
 * <span style="color:#ff0088"><i class="fas fa-sort-amount-down"></i></span> Improving Model Evaluation

I have co-authored papers that were cited as "outstanding" and "honorable mention for best paper" at [ACL 2020](https://aclanthology.org/2020.acl-main.740/) and [ACL 2021](https://aclanthology.org/2021.acl-long.565/).
